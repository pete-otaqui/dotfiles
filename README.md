Dotfiles
========

Some mac / linux friendly dotfiles for bash, vim and git

Installation
------------

To install, checkout the repository wherever you like and link the specific dotfiles you want like so:

```bash
ln -s ~/dotfiles/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```

Note that if you are using the vim config it requires [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) first.
